=========

This is an application that takes user inputs in real language and puts them into an equity valuation model to generate 
customized stock prices.  It aims to make it easier for average investors to generate their own stock values by taking 
care of the more sophisticated parts of economic calculation for them.

Tasks to complete:
[ ] - Launch a rails application to house the files
[ ] - Add a function that pulls real-time stock prices
[ ] - Write the values from a .csv into a PostgreSQL database
[ ] - Pull the database values into the 'frame'
